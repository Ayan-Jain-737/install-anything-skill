# install-anything

Universal GitHub repository and skill installer for AI agent harnesses.

```bash
/install-anything find react
/install-anything install https://github.com/user/repo
/install-anything diagnose https://github.com/user/repo
/install-anything list-installed
/install-anything uninstall <id> --force
```

Automatically detects language, framework, dependencies, and agent skills from any GitHub repository, registers skills into your active agent's folder (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Hermes, etc.) and global canonical storage (`~/.agents/skills/`), and configures executables for your environment without modifying unused agent folders.
